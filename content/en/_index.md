## About Us

![](/images/illustrations/developer-analysis2.jpg)

The DevEx Institute exists to equip developers and practitioners with the resources they need to advocate for the tools and services that optimize their developer experience (DevEx). We’re a developer-centric organization, independent of any vendors.  

Imagine a world where developers have the power to shape their ideal development environment. That’s the future we’re working towards. By uniting developers and practitioners, we can transform DevEx from a silent wish list to a prioritized business objective.
